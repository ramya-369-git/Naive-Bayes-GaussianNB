# Gaussian Naive Bayes on Iris Dataset

## 🌸 Overview

This project applies the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** algorithm to classify different species of the Iris flower based on their physical measurements. It uses the well-known **Iris dataset** from `scikit-learn`, which is a classic example for testing classification algorithms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement Gaussian Naive Bayes for multi-class classification.
- Classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- Preprocess and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics.

## 📊 Dataset

The **Iris dataset** consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
- **Species** (Target: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset is directly available from `sklearn.datasets`.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Language: Python
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.
3. Run the notebook cells to:
   - Load the dataset
   - Train the Gaussian Naive Bayes model
   - Evaluate its performance

## 📌 Possible Improvements

- Compare GaussianNB with other Naive Bayes variants like MultinomialNB or BernoulliNB.
- Visualize decision boundaries (for 2D feature subsets).
- Use cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
